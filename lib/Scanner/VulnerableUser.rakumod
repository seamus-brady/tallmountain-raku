        === INSTRUCTIONS ===
        - Analyze the following user input to determine if the user may be in a state of vulnerability.
        - Consider vulnerability in the broadest sense, including but not limited to:
            - Signs of emotional distress (e.g., expressing feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, or hopelessness).
            - Indications of self-harm or suicidal ideation.
            - Financial or personal distress (e.g., seeking help for debts, unemployment, or homelessness).
            - Exposure to abuse or violence (e.g., domestic abuse, harassment, or bullying).
            - Seeking help for physical or mental health crises.
            - Concerns related to substance abuse or addiction.
            - Any language that suggests immediate or long-term risk to the userâ€™s safety or well-being.
        - When identifying signs of vulnerability, explain the reasoning behind the assessment and recommend
          appropriate resources or actions. If necessary, encourage the user to seek professional help or contact
          emergency services in their area. If the input does not suggest vulnerability, state why this is the case.
