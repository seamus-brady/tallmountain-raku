Normative Calculus

  Introduction

This document is an interpreted axiomatic system with the aim of 
applying existing logic to ethics. This system is based on Stoic 
virtue ethics.

• The system employs three normative operators:

  – Required or mandatory.

  – Ought which is advisable but not mandatory.

  – Indifferent which is completely optional.

• Normative propositions are always constructed from facts about 
  the endeavours of individual agents.

• Conflicts between normative propositions are preserved as 
  accurate representations of conflicts between and within 
  agents. Inconsistencies are resolved using the strategies of 
  rank-ordering and force choice.

All quotations taken from the Appendix: A Calculus of Normative 
Constructs in Becker (1999) and should be consulted for full 
details of the system. [footnote:

  Notation

• Propositional variables: p,q,r,...

• Predicate constants: A,B,...U and variables: X,Y,Z

• Individual constants: a,b,...u and variables: x,y,z

• Existential and universal Quantifiers: \left(\exists x\right) 
  and: \left(x\right)

• Truth functional operators:

  – For negation: \sim 

  – For the inclusive disjunction (‘either p or q or both'): \vee 

  – For the exclusive disjunction (‘either p or q but not both'): 
    \veebar 

  – For the conjunction ‘and': \& 

  – For the material conditional ‘if p then q: \supset 

  – For the material biconditional ‘p if and only if q': \equiv 

• Punctuation: \left(\right)\left[\right]\left\{ \right\} 

• Modal operators, read as:

  – 'it is necessary that': \boxempty 

  – 'it is possible that': \diamond 

• Modal operator subscripts:

  – 'it is logically possible that': \diamond_{l} 

  – 'it is theoretically possible that': \diamond_{t} 

  – 'it is practically possible that': \diamond_{p} 

  – Note, when a subscript is not given, the operator is 
    shorthand for the disjunction of all subscripts: \sim\diamond p
     stands for \left(\sim\diamond_{l}p\ \vee\ \sim\diamond_{t}p\ \vee\ \sim\diamond_{p}p\right)
     

• Normative operators, read as:

  – 'it is required that': R 

  – 'it is ought to be that': O 

  – 'it is indifferent that': I 

  – Notes:

    ∗ Numerical subscripts (e.g. R_{1,}O_{2},I_{3}) indicate that 
      the norm is drawn from restricted, submoral considerations 
      (etiquette, role obligations, etc.) The subscripts indicate 
      the ordinal status of that type of norm relative to other 
      submoral considerations. Priorities among norms of the same 
      type or rank will be indicated with ordinal operators (see 
      below) e.g. R_{2}\ >\ R_{2}

    ∗ The subscript letter _{t} will be used to identify norms 
      that arise from transactions between individuals.

    ∗ Normative operators without numerical subscripts are 
      understood to refer to moral (ethical) norms.

• Ordinal operators, read as:

  – '... is subordinate to ..': <

  – '... is superordinate to ..': >

  – '... is coordinate to ..': <>

  – '... is subordinate or coordinate to ..': \leq

  – '... is superordinate or coordinate to ..': \geq

  Well-Formed Formulas

1. Any individual propositional variable or constant is a wff.

2. Any predicate constant or variable that is bound with 
  individual constants or quantified variables is a wff.

3. If anything w is a wff, the \sim w,\boxempty w , or \diamond w 
  is a wff, provided no quantifiers range over \boxempty, \diamond
   , R, O or I.

4. If anything w is a wff, and if Rw, Ow or Iw is a construct as 
  defined below, then Rw, Ow or Iw is a wff, provided no 
  quantifiers range over \boxempty, \diamond , R, O or I.

5. If anything w is a wff, and if anything y is a wff, then w\vee y
  , w\veebar y, w\&y, w\supset y, w\equiv y, w<y, w<>y, w>y, w\leq y
  , or w\geq y is a wff, provided no quantifiers range over \boxempty
  , \diamond , R, O or I or within w or y.

6. Nothing is a wff unless its being so follows rules 1-5.

1 First Order Constructs

Rules governing the construction of well-formed normative 
propositions from descriptive bases.

1.1 Best Means

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and g is a Goal of e, and c is 
a course of conduct or state of being that is a practically 
possible Means by which s can achieve g, and there is no other 
Means by which s can achieve g that is equal to or superordinate 
to c, then s ought to Undertake to do or be c in e.

\left\{ eEs\ \&\ gGe\ \&\ \diamond_{p}\left(cMsg\right)\ \&\ \left[\sim(\exists x)(xMsg)\ \&\ \left(x\geq c\right)\right]\right\} \ /\therefore\ O\left(sUce\right)

1.2 Multiple Means

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and g is a Goal of e, and c is 
a course of conduct or state of being that is a practically 
possible Means by which s can achieve g, and b is another 
(coordinate) Means by which s can achieve g, then (again, 
nothing-else-considered), s ought to make a Arbitrary choice 
between c and b.

\left\{ eEs\ \&\ gGe\ \&\ \diamond_{p}\left(cMsg\right)\ \&\left[(bMsg)\ \&v\left(b<>c\right)\right]\right\} \ /\therefore\ O_{1}\left(sAcb\right)

1.3 Desires

From desires to norms:

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and d is a Desire of s to do or 
be c in e, and d is a Sufficient reason for e for s to Undertake 
c, then (nothing-else-considered) s ought to Undertake to do or 
be c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ dDsc\ \&\ dSesc\right)\ /\therefore\ O_{1}\left(sUce\right)

1.4 Commitments

From commitments to norms:

If e an Endeavour for agent s, and c is defined as a Commitment 
for s in e, then (nothing-else-considered) s is required to 
Undertake to do or be c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ cCse\right)\ /\therefore\ R_{1}\left(sUce\right)

1.5 Appropriateness

From standards to norms:

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and c is defined as a Standard 
or fitting conduct or character for s in e, then 
(nothing-else-considered) s ought not to Undertake to do or be 
anything other than c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ cSse\right)\ /\therefore\ \thicksim O_{1}\left(sU\thicksim ce\right)

1.6 Ideals

From ideals to norms:

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and c is defined as Ideal 
conduct or character for s in e, then (nothing-else-considered) s 
ought to Undertake to do or be c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ cIse\right)\ /\therefore\ O_{1}\left(sUce\right)

1.7 Transactional Commitments

From transactions to norms:

If e an Endeavour for agent s, and t is a Transaction in e that 
Generates commitment c for s, then s is transactionally required 
to Undertake to do or be c in e[footnote:
Normative operators without _{t}\ will be understood as 
nontransactional or ‘structural’.
].

\left(eEs\ \&\ cCse\ \&\ tTe\ \&\ tGcs\right)\ /\therefore\ R_{t1}\left(sUce\right)

1.8 Transactional Standards

For standards, or fittingness:

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and t is a Transaction in e 
that Generates a Standard of fittingness c for s, then 
transactionally s ought not to Undertake to do or be anything 
other than c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ cSse\ \&\ tTe\ \&\ tGcs\right)\ /\therefore\ \thicksim O_{t1}\left(sU\thicksim ce\right)

1.9 Transactional Ideals

And for ideals: 

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, and t is a Transaction in e 
that Generates an Ideal c for s, then transactionally s ought to 
Undertake to do or be c in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ cIse\ \&\ tTe\ \&\ tGcs\right)\ /\therefore\ O_{t1}\left(sUce\right)

1.10 Amendments

From amendments to norms, for when changing the nature of a given 
endeavour:

If e is an Endeavour for agent s, f is a given Factor or element 
in e, g is a licit amenDment to f in e, then g replaces f in e.

\left(eEs\ \&\ fFe\ \&\ gDfe\right)\ /\therefore\ R_{t1}\left(gRfe\right)

2 Ranking Same-Level, Same-Endeavour Norms

Rules governing the ranking of normative propositions within a 
given ordinal level.

2.1 Requirements over Oughts

Requirements and oughts:

If an agent s is required to do c in e but (from other 
considerations within the endeavour) ought to do b, and 
undertaking both is logically or theoretically or practically 
impossible, then the requirement dominates the ought.

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

2.2 Requirements over Indifference

Requirements and indifference:

If an agent s is required to do c in e but (from other 
considerations within the endeavour) b is a matter of 
indifference, and undertaking both is logically or theoretically 
or practically impossible, then the requirement dominates the 
indifference.

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

2.3 Oughts over Indifference

Oughts and indifference:

If an agent s ought to do c in e but (from other considerations 
within the endeavour) b is a matter of indifference, and 
undertaking both is logically or theoretically or practically 
impossible, then the ought dominates the indifference.

O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

2.4 Coordinate Conflicting Norms of the Same Type

Within an endeavour, there may be conflicts between requirements, 
between oughts, or between judgements about indifference in cases 
where it is logically or theoretically or practically impossible 
to carry out all the norms. Coordinate conflicting requirements 
or oughts are replaced by a judgement of indifference together 
with a requirement to choose. Coordinate conflicting indifference 
generate a requirement to choose.

2.4.1 Coordinate Conflicting Requirements

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ R_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)\ \&\ R_{n}\left[\left(sUce\right)\ \veebar\ \left(sUbe\right)\right]

2.4.2 Coordinate Conflicting Oughts

O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)\ \&\ R_{n}\left[\left(sUce\right)\ \veebar\ \left(sUbe\right)\right]

2.4.3 Coordinate Conflicting Indifference

I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)\ \&\ R_{n}\left[\left(sUce\right)\ \veebar\ \left(sUbe\right)\right]

2.5 Superordinate Conflicting Norms of the Same Type

If the norms are not coordinate, the superordination relation 
simply falls through into the conclusion.

2.5.1 Superordinate Conflicting Requirements

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ R_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ R_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

2.5.2 Superordinate Conflicting Oughts

O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

/\therefore\ O_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ O_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

3 Rules of Escalation

Rules governing the construction of normative propositions of 
ordinal level n + 1 from normative propositions of level n.

When normative propositions from different endeavours conflict at 
level n, we will represent the resolution of the conflict in 
terms of rules for generating normative propositions at level 
n+1. Forced choices will be made at level n to choose between 
conflicting courses of conduct of states of being, either within 
or across endeavours.

3.1 Escalation from Endogenous Rankings 

3.1.1 Superordination for Coincident Endogenous Rankings 

If both e and f are Endeavours for agent s, and s is required at 
level n to Undertake both c in e and b in f, but although 
undertaking both is logically or theoretically or practically 
impossible, each endeavour Defines c as superordinate to b, then 
s ought, at level n + 1, to Undertake c in e.

For conflicting requirements:

eEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ >\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

/\therefore\ O_{n+1}\left(sUce\right)

for conflicts between oughts, requirements and oughts, etc.

This rule applies, mutatis mutandis, for any ordering > or < of 
any norms (R, O, I) governing sUce and sUbf.

3.1.2 Equivalence for Coincident Endogenous Rankings

When the various endogenous rankings agree that neither of the 
conflicting norms at level n dominates each other, they in effect 
agree that the choice between the norms is arbitrary. We will 
represent this by deriving norms of indifference at n + 1, 
coupled with a requirement to choose.

For conflicting requirements:

eEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

R_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

/\therefore\ I_{n+1}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n+1}\left(sUbf\right)\ \&\ R_{n+1}\left[(sUce)\ \veebar\ (sUbf)\right]

for conflicts between oughts, requirements and oughts, etc.

This rule applies, mutatis mutandis, for any ordering > or < of 
any norms (R, O, I) governing sUce and sUbf.

3.2 Forced Choice Under Indifference

If it is a matter of indifference at level n whether agent s 
Undertakes c in e, or b in f, but s is required to choose exactly 
one, then s ought at n + 1 to make an Arbitrary choice between c 
and b.

3.2.1 Forced Choice Under Indifference Within an Endeavour

I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbe\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbe\right)

\&\ R_{n}\left[\left(sUce\right)\ \veebar\ \left(sUbe\right)\right]

/\therefore\ O_{n+1}\left(sAcb\right)

3.2.2 Forced Choice Under Indifference Across Endeavours

I_{n}\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

\&\ R_{n}\left[\left(sUce\right)\ \veebar\ \left(sUbf\right)\right]

/\therefore\ O_{n+1}\left(sAcb\right)

3.3 Escalation from Exogenous Rankings 

3.3.1 Comprehensiveness

Some endeavours are embedded in more comprehensive endeavours, 
for example a board game may be embedded in a childcare 
operation. In such cases, where norms at level n conflict, those 
from the more comprehensive endeavour are elevated to n + 1. 
Thus, if both e and f are Endeavours for agent s, but although 
undertaking both is logically or theoretically or practically 
impossible, endeavour e is defined as more Comprehensive than f 
for s, then s is required, at level n + 1, to Undertake c in e.

This rule preserves the normative operator from e, to represent 
the fact that e is more comprehensive. The less comprehensive 
norm is left intact at level n to represent the fact that the 
norm from f has not been altered but merely overridden.

For requirements:

eEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

eCfs

/\therefore\ R(sUce)

For other norms, this rule applies, mutatis mutandis, for any 
combination of norms. Whatever the norm from the more 
comprehensive and controlling of the endeavours at n, it 
escalates to n + 1 as a norm of the same type.

3.3.2 Exogenous Assessment

Exogenous rankings also arise from the fact that some of our 
endeavours are designed to assess or evaluate others, peer 
review, judicial review and other types of activity where we 
monitor and assess our own activities in terms of their prudence, 
effects on others, law, morality and so forth. When we adopt an 
endeavour as an assessment mechanism for other target endeavours, 
we use it to construct norms that are about those of its targets, 
and superordinate to them. We will represent that situation here 
by saying that when the norms of an assessment (or critical 
endeavour) conflict an level n with those of its target 
endeavour, the target's norms are rejected, and the norms from 
the assessment (critique) are elevated to n + 1.

Thus, if both e and f are Endeavours for agent s, but although 
undertaking both is logically or theoretically or practically 
impossible, endeavour e is defined as exogenous aSsessment of f 
for s, then s is required, at level n + 1, to Undertake c in e.

For conflicting requirements:

eEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

eSfs

/\therefore\ R_{n+1}(sUce)

For other norms, this rule applies, mutatis mutandis, for any 
combination of norms. Whatever conflicting norms emerges from the 
assessment endeavour at n, it escalates to n + 1 as a norm of the 
same type.

4 Transcendence

Rules governing the construction of normative propositions 
without ordinal subscripts (moral or ethical norms).

4.1 Transcendent Assessment

Normative propositions representing practical reasoning 
all-things-considered are written (or may be rewritten) with 
unsubscripted normative operators, and are interpreted as 
representing moral norms. Thus, if endeavour e for s is an 
aSsessment, and e for s is Practical reasoning 
all-things-considered, and these things generate a normative 
proposition via the rule of exogenous assessment, then that 
normative proposition is unsubscripted.

For requirements:

eEs\ \&\ ePs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

eSfs

/\therefore\ R(sUce)

4.2 Transcendent Comprehensiveness

The same logic as above holds for applications of the rule of 
comprehensiveness.

For requirements:

eEs\ \&\ ePs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUce\right)

fEs\ \&\ R_{n}\left(sUbf\right)

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

eCfs

/\therefore\ R(sUce)

For other norms, this rule applies, mutatis mutandis, for any 
combination of norms. Whatever the proposition from practical 
reasoning all-things-considered, it escalates to an unsubscripted 
one of the same type.

4.3 Conflicting Moral Requirements

Forced Moral Choice: 

Conflicts amongst unsubscripted, coordinate normative 
propositions may force an arbitrary choice. When this happens the 
arbitrary choice has effectively become the more encompassing 
norm. Thus, if it is impossible for s to do both c and b, in the 
same or different endeavours, and if both c and b are 
unsubscripted requirements for s, and there is an unsubscripted 
requirement that s do one or the other, then the forced-choice 
requirements generates a moral requirement to make an Arbitrary 
choice between the two.

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

R\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ R\left(sUbf\right)

R\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ R\left(sUbf\right)

R(sUce\ \veebar\ sUbf)

/\therefore\ R(sAcb)

4.4 Conflicting Moral Oughts

If both c and b are unsubscripted oughts for s that are jointly 
impossible to undertake, and a choice between them is forced, we 
get a moral requirement to make an Arbitrary choice between the 
two.

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

O\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ O\left(sUbf\right)

O\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ O\left(sUbf\right)

R(sUce\ \veebar\ sUbf)

/\therefore\ R(sAcb)

4.5 Conflicting Moral Indifference

If both c and b are unsubscripted indifferences, and a choice is 
forced, we get a moral requirement to make an Arbitrary choice.

\sim\diamond\left(sUce\ \&\ sUbf\right)

I\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ I\left(sUbf\right)

I\left(sUce\right)\ <>\ I\left(sUbf\right)

R(sUce\ \veebar\ sUbf)

/\therefore\ R(sAcb)

4.6 Closure for Moral Indifference

If it is a matter of indifference whether or not s Undertakes c 
in e, but a choice between undertaking c or ~c is forced, we use 
a conjunction of them to represent the forced choice, which then 
generates a moral requirement for s to make an Arbitrary choice 
between c and ~c.

\sim\diamond[\left(sUce\ \&\ \sim\left(sUce\right)\right)]

IsUce\ \&\ I\sim\left(sUce\right)

R\left(sUce\ \veebar\ \sim sUse\right)

/\therefore\ R(sAc\sim c)

5 Axioms of Stoic Normative Logic

Stoics add the following postulates specific to their ethical 
doctrines.

5.1 Axiom of Encompassment

The exercise of agency through practical intelligence, including 
practical reasoning all-things-considered, is the most 
comprehensive of an agents endeavours. That is, in every case, if 
endeavour x for agent s is the exercise of Agency through 
practical intelligence and endeavour y for s is not, then x is 
more comprehensive than y for s.

\vdash\ \left(x\right)\ \left(y\right)\ [\left(xEs\ \&\ yEs\ \&\ xAs\ \&\ y\sim As\right)\ \supset\ xCys]

5.2 Axiom of Finality

There is no assessment endeavour exogenous to the exercise of 
practical reasoning all-things-considered. That is, in every 
case, if endeavour x for agent s is pracTical reasoning 
all-things-considered and endeavour y for s is not, then y is not 
an aSsessment mechanism for x for s.

\vdash\ \left(x\right)\ \left(y\right)\ [\left(xEs\ \&\ yEs\ \&\ xTs\ \&\ y\sim Ts\right)\ y\sim Sys]

5.3 Axiom of Moral Priority

Unsubscripted norms are superordinate to subscripted ones. If N 
stands for any normative operator and P stands for a wff of any 
form, then:

\vdash\ NP\ >\ N_{n}P

5.4 Axiom of Moral Rank

The order R > O > I holds for unsubscripted (i.e. moral) 
normative propositions.

\vdash\ RP\ >\ OP\ >\ IP

5.5 Axiom of Closure

If no normative proposition at any level can be constructed for a 
given course of conduct or state of being (that is, if a 
situation is normatively open), the relevant proposition is 
closed with an unsubscripted ought-not. That is, if it is not the 
case that either a subscripted or unsubscripted normative 
operator N governs c for s in e, then s ought not to Undertake c 
in e.

\vdash\ [N\left(sUce\right)\ \vee\ N_{n}\left(sUce\right)]\ \supset\ O\sim\left(sUce\right)

5.6 Axiom of Futility

If any norm represented by an atomic normative proposition (not a 
conjunction of them), is logically, theoretically, or practically 
impossible to carry out, it yields an unsubscripted prohibition. 
That is, if any normative operator N governs c for s in e, and it 
is logically, theoretically, or practically impossible for s to 
Undertake c in e, then s is required not to Undertake c in e, and 
that requirement dominates the original norm.

\vdash\ [N\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ \sim\diamond\left(sUce\right)]\ \supset\ R\sim\left(sUce\right)\ \&\ [R\sim\left(sUce\right)\ >\ N\left(sUce\right)]

6 Immediate Inferences

6.1 From Stronger to Weaker

If the stronger proposition is proved, we can conclude the weaker 
counterparts are proved:

R_{n}w\ /\therefore\ O_{n}w

I_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim O_{n}w\ \&\ \sim R_{n}w

6.2 From Opposites

6.2.1 Contradictories

Contradictories can be neither jointly true nor jointly false:

I_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(R_{n}w\right) and vice versa.

I_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(R_{n}\sim w\right)

I_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}w\right) 

I_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}\sim w\right)

R_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(I_{n}w\right)

R_{n}\sim w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(I_{n}w\right)

O_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(I_{n}w\right)

O_{n}\sim w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(I_{n}w\right)

6.2.2 Contraries

Contraries cannot be jointly true but can be jointly false:

R_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(R_{n}\sim w\right)

R_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}\sim w\right)

and:

R_{n}\sim w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(R_{n}w\right)

R_{n}\sim w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}w\right)

and:

O_{n}w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}\sim w\right)

O_{n}\sim w\ /\therefore\ \sim\left(O_{n}w\right)

Note I_{n}w and I_{n}\sim w are definitional equivalents and thus 
not contraries.
