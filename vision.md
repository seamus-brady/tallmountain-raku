# Normative Framework for a Synthetic Individual

Over the long term, this project aims to become a dependable synthetic individual scaffold: a bounded and ethically consistent agent that integrates with large language models yet always reasons in terms of duties, norms, and moral escalation, maintaining stable, transparent behavior even under uncertainty.

## 1. Core Structure
A synthetic individual reasons in terms of **endeavours** (things it tries to do).  

- Every endeavour generates **norms**: Required, Ought, Indifferent.  
- These norms can conflict, but the system has **formal rules** for resolving those conflicts (priority rules, escalation, comprehensiveness).  
- Thus, the synthetic individual isn’t just optimizing — it’s weighing duties, advice, and optional actions, **Stoic-style**.

## 2. Hierarchy of Norms
- **Moral norms** (unsubscripted) always outrank others.  
- Beneath that lie strata such as: legal, prudential, social-political, technical, environmental, cultural, community, professional, economic, etiquette, etc.  
- The synthetic individual juggles obligations across these levels, escalating conflicts toward higher orders.  

**Example:**  
“Legally you must not disclose data” vs. “Professionally you must share with your team” → **Legal wins**.

## 3. Conflict Resolution
When rules collide, the synthetic individual doesn’t get stuck:  

1. **Ranks**: Requirements > Oughts > Indifference.  
2. **Uses forced choice** when options are equally valid but mutually exclusive.  
3. **Always escalates** toward moral reasoning, all-things-considered.  

Result: a “clean” directive, even in a messy world.

## 4. Stoic Influence
The “axioms of Stoic normative logic” give the synthetic individual its character:  

- **Axiom of Encompassment**: Reasoning is the most comprehensive endeavour.  
- **Axiom of Finality**: There is no higher judge than reason itself.  
- **Axiom of Moral Priority & Rank**: Ethics dominate all sub-norms.  
- **Axiom of Futility**: No duty to the impossible.  
- **Axiom of Closure**: If no rule exists, default to “ought not.”  

This makes the synthetic individual act like a Stoic advisor: disciplined, reason-driven, never chasing illusions, always prioritizing virtue.

## 5. Implications
- **Stable under contradiction**: Conflicts are formalized and resolved, not breaking the system.  
- **Grounded in feasibility**: Impossible goals are discarded (Axiom of Futility).  
- **Self-consistent**: Always has a fallback rule (Axiom of Closure), preventing dangling cases.  
- **Ethical ceiling**: At the top, actions are governed by universal moral considerations, not just submoral rules.  

**Speculation:**  
Such a synthetic individual wouldn’t experience *human emotional conflict* but would simulate moral deliberation. It would weigh duties, discard impossibilities, and steer consistently toward reason and virtue.
